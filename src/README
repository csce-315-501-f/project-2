server.py:

    IMPORTANT:
    In order to play a game, you must first compile the board.cpp file into an executable
    named 'board' using the following command:
        g++ board.cpp -o board
        or
        make
    Failure to do so will result in the server not being able to run the board backend process.

    To start the server use the following command:
        python server.py
    If you set the executable bit on the server.py file you can just use:
        ./server.py
    The server starts by default on port 8888 but you can change that by providing an argument
    after server.py. I.E:
        ./server.py 8989
    will set the server to start on port 8989


To connect and play:
    Use telnet to connect to the server. If the server is running on unix.cs.tamu.edu on the default
    port you would use the following command:
        telnet unix.cs.tamu.edu 8888
    The server will greet you will the "WELCOME" message in response. At this time you must enter
    your game settings. When all settings are complete the server will respond with a comment noting
    that the game has started. You will always be the "O" piece and will always go first.

    Note: all commands are case INSENSITIVE

    Undo your last move:    UNDO
    Exit game:              EXIT
